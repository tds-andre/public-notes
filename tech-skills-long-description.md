# Technical Skills
Resume, André Teixeira dos Santos, Engineering Roles

## Python
For the past 5 years, Python has been my go-to language for general-purpose programming, data processing, analytics, and machine learning, with strong fluency and deep understanding of its ecosystem, packaging (pip), strengths, weaknesses, and style. Previously, I used C# for general-purpose tasks and R, Octave, and Excel for data/analytics/ML. Experienced with TensorFlow (not PyTorch) for neural networks; Pandas, NumPy, and CuPy for data processing; Scikit-learn for non-neural ML; Prefect for orchestration; Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization; Dash for analytical web apps (mostly read-only); Flask for REST APIs and web servers; and SQLAlchemy for ORM in complex transactional systems.

## Power BI
From 2017–2021, I led 15+ Power BI projects for enterprises like AB InBev, delivering standalone solutions or hybrids (e.g., with Azure ML Studio), earning recognition as a statewide leader in the technology with comprehensive knowledge of its features, licensing, and constraints. It enables stunning, flexible visual design for dashboards, data visualization, storytelling, and ad-hoc analysis, with robust out-of-the-box features (e.g., bookmarks, cross-filtering, drill-down/through) and powerful embedded data ingestion and processing. Since 2021, after changing jobs, I’ve used it for ad-hoc visualization and local dashboards, replacing Excel, SQL, and Jupyter workflows with a faster, prettier, and more organized tool.

## SQL
Since 2008, I’ve gained extensive SQL experience, designing and querying relational databases for transactional systems (optimized for single-row transactions with ACID needs, often using ORMs in 3NF) and analytical applications (e.g., Data Warehouses/Data Marts with bulk unindexed loads, fast bulk reads, and denormalized forms).

## Web
Full understanding and considerable experience, since 2008, with web technologies (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS, HTTP, front-end frameworks, single page applications, back-end development of REST services or server-side MVC) and capable of full-stack development. Exploratory experience with Angular, React and Android development. Most recent experiences were: 1) developing a charting and mapping JS library (ESM & UMD) that encapsulates performative client-side rendering (canvas for high-volume data) and data access into a single component, backed by ECharts, D3js and Leaflet (2025); 2) Full-stack development of a wind-powered hydrogen production simulator, served with Python/Dash and integrated with a Matlab simulation engine (2024).


## Java
Developed two Java-based products, gaining language and ecosystem expertise. As Tech Lead, I built a B2B web platform for industry-wide ML model sharing using Spring Boot (2015-16, national). I also contributed to a RF Spectrum Sharing system’s physics engine and interference optimization heuristics with vanilla Java and extensive unit testing, achieving 20x speed gains against reference implementation (2024-25).

## CUDA
Development and optimization of DSP/ML pipelines with custom CUDA kernels (e.g., polyphase channelizer) that sourced RF signals from the antenna directly to GPU memory and feed quantized TensorRT neural models that I developed, running on edge devices (AIR-T, Artificial Intelligence Radio Transceiver), for RADAR detection and localization capabilities.

## C/C++
First language learned in grad school, later applying it professionally ocasionally in performance-critial systems. Recently used to write CUDA kernels and to integrate an ITM model (Longley-Rice).

## Cloud Services
I have limited cloud experience, learning as needed without formal training. Most projects I’ve collaborated on used on-premises infrastructure, limiting my exposure to specific cloud services.

## Big Data Tools
Basic experience with NoSQL databases (ArangoDB, CouchDB, MongoDB) and HDFS/Parquet. Used Hadoop, Spark, and Scala on one project long ago. Most projects, even with voluminous data (dozens of terabytes) and speed constraints, didn’t need specialized big data tools. Never used Databricks. Personallly I find the term to be a scam =D

## Peripheral Tools
I’m Windows user comfortable with accessing Linux systems via SSH/VPNs, using bash and remote development. I've used Git since its inception and SVN prior. Nowadays I exclusively develop using VS Code, but have experience with other IDEs (VStudio, Eclipse, Jupyter, RStudio). I know enough to work with Docker, CI/CD, Maven and NPM. Recently, my workflow seamlessly integrated Grok (no experience with Copilot or similar tools), complementing Googles use cases.
